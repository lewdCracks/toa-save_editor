 **v6.01 Warning: 6.01 is in a semi-stable state, meaning all but a few things work and one that does work is unstable.**
   - *The location editor currently works, however it is buggy and the info it uses it not yet up to date, use at your own risk.*
   - *The node editor currently appears to do nothing, meaning it's doing something I just don't know what and haven't bothered to check and for all I know it's not hooked up.*
